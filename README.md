The linear regression model aims to predict road accident severity based on road class, weather conditions, number of vehicles, etc. 

 Dataset Description:
Source: Road Traffic Accidents Dataset
Features: Various factors like Easting, Northing, Number of Vehicles, 1st Road Class, Age of Casualty.
Target Variable: Casualty Severity (Slight, Serious, Fatal)

 Model Creation:
I used a Linear Regression model to predict accident severity. The dataset was split into training and testing sets. Categorical variables were encoded using LabelEncoder. The model was trained and evaluated using Mean Squared Error.

 The Evaluation:
Mean Squred Error: 0.1100
Graphs
Predictions for Hypothetical Example: Accident Severity Prediction = 1.9050

 
  Benefits of Model Application in developing Countries:

This model can be used to help governments and authorities in underdeveloped countries to:
1)Identify high risk areas-By analyzing accident severity based on geographical data, road conditions, and lighting, authorities can identify accident prone zones and prioritize safety improvements.
2)Optimize resources for road safety improvements- The model can help governments allocate limited resources to the most critical areas, such as adding street lights, improving road surfaces, and weather-proofing roads.
3)Implement preventive measures based on predictions-  By predicting accident severity, preventive measures such as traffic rerouting or speed control can be implemented to reduce casualties.
